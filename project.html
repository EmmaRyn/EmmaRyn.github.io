              <p>
                Since there are so many storage applications out there, I really
                needed to design one that would make users choose this one and
                still meet the standards of existing apps.

              <p>Complexity and Flexibility</p>
              <p>
                A recipe on a website has cook time, servings, nutrition,
                ingredients, directions and images all laid out. A lot of this
                information isn’t immediately available if it’s a family recipe
                or you haven’t made it yet. This application needs to be able
                to hold all the important information without relying on it all
                 being available on creation.

              <p>Simplicity</p>
              <p>
                Recipe sites that currently exist all have a lot going on. This
                application needed to be designed so that it was able to do
                everything that a recipe application needed to do without being
                overwhelming and difficult to use.

            Heirloom is focused on storing personal recipes whether it is a
            family recipe or one you just cooked using HelloFresh.<br/>
            <strong>
              The key to this application’s simplicity is its flexibility.

            Share recipes with friends and family but keep them private so you
            can keep the secret ingredient a secret.

            Organize recipes into collections when you add them or save
            that for later.

          <p>
            With <strong>29 survey participants</strong>, I was able to learn
            a lot about how cloud storage apps are used now, likes, dislikes
            and I could gauge interest in a recipe-focused app.
            I asked which kinds of documents people would like to have
            an app dedicated to, recipes being one them,
            and <strong>38% of the users selected recipes</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turns out a lot of people keep recipes in a box or drawer
            and are interested in sharing recipes privately with family
            and friends. The survey <strong>confirmed the direction of the app
            </strong>and was extremely helpful in the creation and prioritization
            of user stories.

            I did a SWOT analysis of Dropbox, Pinterest

            The onboarding flow was easy since I was able to reference
            Yummly’s process. I also created flows for sharing, organizing
            and adding recipes.

          <p>
            I used the user stories to determine what needs to be included
            in these flows and utilized the other user flows I created for
            Dropbox and Pinterest to guide me.

            How would someone use this application for their family recipes
            versus recipes found online?
          </p>
          <p>
            What kind of information will this user need or want for a recipe?
          </p>
          <p>
            What demographic is this being designed for?
          </p>
          <p>
            Answering all these questions helped me determine different use
            cases for this application which helped me create and prioritize
            user stories and design the application itself.

            From the survey and many iterations of testing,<br/>
            I was given a lot of feedback on features people would<br/>
            like to see in a recipes application.
          </p>
          <p>
            I needed to sort through all these and determine what is<br/>
            mandatory for the Minimum Viable Product, what would <br/>
            be great to have and what can be in another round <br/>
            of this application’s development.

            I iterated many times on many of the screens.

          <p>
            Designing the <strong>“Add Recipe”</strong> screens were the toughest
            to figure out. There needed to be room to add a lot
            of recipe information in an easy and efficient way.

        </div>
          <p>
            Going through the process of creating wireframes and testing them
            put the user flows into perspective. After creating some screens
            needed for adding a recipe, I realized that some screens should be
            reordered and some things were never considered. For example,
            having friends within the application to share recipes with worked
            in the user flow, but when building the wireframes I realized this
            concept was never fully developed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The usability testing of the wireframe prototype revealed that the
            processes for adding a recipe and organizing a collection were
            confusing so this needed to be redesigned.

          <p>
            Determining the font styles and the primary branding colors
            greatly improved the efficiency of creating the mockups. It gave
            me guidelines to begin my work with.  Once I could see how those
            branding decisions affected the designs and prototype testing,
            then I was able to tweak here and there. I ended up removing the
            darkest color from the styleguide as that was never used, I
            tweaked the icons and removed the logos that seemed like they
            would never be utilized.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also spent some time on logo design. The shape of the tomato
            changed. Then I played with coloring and brand fonts. Then I tried
            some different text placement. I ended with this logo which I am
            pretty happy with as it is my first logo design.

          <p>
            The first mockup I created attempted to mimic an actual recipe
            card. The feedback from the usability testing that most greatly
            influenced the final design was how different the “add recipe”
            screens were from the “view recipe” screens. Being able to
            visualize the end-result when creating the recipe is extremely
            important. Overall, the process of adding a recipe could be
            simplified and the hierarchy of the home page also needed some
            adjustment.
          </p>

          alt="Heirloom High Fidelity Mockup Round Two" />
          <p>
            Using the feedback from the design critique, I created a second
            hi-fi mockup. It kept similar styling but laid out the information
            on the page in a different way. The “view recipe” screen more
            closely matched the “add recipe” screens, but the design was
            still just a little too bland and the process of adding a recipe
            needed some rework. Users needed to be guided through the process
            and didn’t know where to begin adding a recipe.

          <p>
            The third mockup was a lot cleaner. The “add” and “view” recipe
            screens matched exactly and users had a much easier time adding a r
            ecipe. They knew where to begin and felt like this would be
            extremely useful when actually cooking. The one thing that lacked
            in this version was the branding. It was missing the “homey” and
            “rustic” feel that the home page has. It was also missing some
            information that users were asking for like Cook Time and Servings.
          </p>

          <p>
            The final mockup added the missing information, a “Print Recipe”
            icon and adjusted some font and icon sizing. The designs were all
            updated to make sure that branding was consistent and clean.

            The journey was long, but a lot of progress was made from my

            Recipes are more complicated than I thought, but all the users who
            tested were excited to use this application. I learned a lot about
            the importance of simplicity, consistency and hierarchy when
            designing an application. Also, finding inspiration from existing
            sites and designs is key for having a design that matches
            modern trends.
