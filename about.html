          <p>
            I was a double major in Computer Science and Cinema in college.
            I came in wanting to write for TV and sophomore year I took a
            computer science class to fulfill my science general requirement.
            It felt like computer science was basically solving logic puzzles
            which are my absolute favorite. I fell in love and signed up for
            a second major.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the mandatory classes was “Human-Computer Interaction”.
            I found out I was the only one in that class who actually
            enjoyed the topics and designing the application screens. I
            thought this was a part of all computer science jobs, but here
            I realized that UX research and design was something I could
            specialize in. Who knew?

        <div id="about-text-2" class="section-body">
          <p>
            I put a career in design on the back burner since I was still
            focused on getting into the film industry.  I had the amazing
            opportunity of editing videos for Warner Bros. Records, but the
            job felt like a solo sport. I wanted to be on a team which is
            when I decided to switch gears and pursue a career as a software
            engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got a job as a front-end software engineer and enjoyed solving
            the business needs of clients with code, but it was missing the
            creativity I used every day during my film classes and projects.
            Then I remembered that UX class! Perfect! A combination of film
            and computer science. What took me so long to come back to that?
          </p>

        <div id="about-text-3" class="section-body">
          <p>
            After studying and practicing design, UX and its impact seem
            magnified. I’ve seen a lot of practices that put design as a low
            priority and seeing the impact it has on clients has made me become
            an advocate for design. Using design and my programming experience,
            I can address the issues I see and get more customer satisfaction
            and retention. Doing this would be extremely fulfilling so I hope
            to do that in the future.
