            <p><span class="article-title">What Is Rating</span><br/>
            In the transportation industry, there is a process called “Rating”
            which is putting a quote from a carrier on a load. This quote can be
            retrieved many ways, one of which is manual entry.</p>
            <p> There are a lot of configurations that can be applied to a
              manual rating screen, such as charge-level currency, charge-level references
              or distributing a charge amongst many loads.</p>

                I am shipping 100 water bottles. I need someone to carry
                them from Raleigh to San Diego.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I call up this carrier that I know does a good job. He says
                "I will do it for $500 plus 2 cents for every mile to cover fuel."
              </p>

            <li>

                I enter in his carrier information and the rate he provided
                and put it onto my load of 100 water bottles.

              <span class="bold">There was a lot learning ahead of me.</span>
              My first step to understanding was learning what Rating is. This
              included external research as well as reading internal documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then I looked at the existing screens within the system and played
              with them to help me understand the current interaction.

              All of this external and internal research helped me learn the

              would be important for communicating with stakeholders.

            I did a search on google and dribbble

          <p class="article-title">Carrier Information</p>
          <p>
          There were two areas of information that I tackled separately. The
          top area of carrier data was just a matter of organizing the fields
          in a way they make sense. I put all possible required fields on the
          left since that would be the first area a user would look at. When
          organizing the rest of the panel, I looked at data length and the
          relationship between other fields into consideration.

          <p class="article-title">Rate Table</p>
          <p>
          When designing the rate table, I lined the input fields up in a way
          that it read like a sentence. One of the problems with the existing
          screen was trying to put too much information on one line and
          cluttering the page with less important details. During the
          redesign, I prioritized the information and went through many
          iterations on how to expose the primary information.

          <p class="article-title">Secondary Charge Details</p>
          <p>
          Anything that was secondary information, was only exposed when a
          charge line was expanded. This helped the page remain simple and
          readable.

          When a development team was ready to pick this up, the Product Owner
          mentioned some Rating features that had not been mentioned up until
          then. This included charge-level currency and assigning charges to a
          specific stop. I quickly had to add in additional fields and re-work
          some of the charge rows to add in more information. We did some
          quick review sessions on these designs and then implementation was
          ready to begin.

          A contractor team was in charge of developing this. This was one of my
          first times directly leading the UX part of an epic. They asked
          questions about components and I answered. I tried to give lots of
          feedback as I watched their progress, but as it was a bit rushed,
          there were some misses.

            I learned that more documentation detailing components and spacing
            is necessary for communicating complex designs, especially with
            contractor groups who are less familiar with the component system.
            I also learned that I need to insert myself more into these
            contractor groups so I can give more immediate feedback, which
            would decrease the number of open UX issues at the end.
