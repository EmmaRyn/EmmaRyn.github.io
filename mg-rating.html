            In the transportation industry, there is a process called “Rating”
            which is adding a quote from a carrier on a load. This quote can be
            retrieved many ways, one of which is manual entry.</p>
            <p> There are many configurations that can be applied to a
              manual rating screen, such as charge-level currency, charge-level references
              and distributing a charge amongst many loads.</p>

              <p>
                I am shipping 100 water bottles. I need someone to carry
                them from Raleigh to San Diego.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I call up a carrier that I trust to do a good job. He says
                "I will do it for $500 plus 2 cents for every mile to cover fuel."
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I enter the carrier information and the rate provided on the
                Carrier Rating screen and save it to my load of 100 water bottles.

            <p>
              I was assigned this project because our customers
              are spread out over three different codebases. We needed everyone on
              the same, newest codebase. However, Carrier Rating wasn't the same on
              every codebase, so I needed to understand the differences and what
              customers actually needed to move to the newest codebase.

              In order to fully understand the problem, my first step was to
              learn about rating and how it works in the MercuryGate software. This
              included external research as well as reading internal documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              I then reviewed the existing screens within the system and simulated
              various scenarios to help me understand the current interaction.

          <p>
          There were two areas of information that I tackled.
          The carrier information needed to be organized in a logical manner. I
          put all required fields on the left, as that would be the first area
          a user would see. For organizing the rest of the carrier information area,
          I considered data length, importance and the relationship between other fields.

          <p class="article-title">Rate Table</p>
          <p>
          When designing the rate table, I organized the input fields to match
          common receipt and invoice models. One of the issues with the existing
          screen was too much information on one line,
          cluttering the page with less important details. During the
          redesign, I prioritized the information and went through many
          iterations on a better way to expose the primary information.

          As the development team was ready to start working on the new design,
          the Product Owner brought up some new features to include. Due to the
          simplification and scalability of the design, I was able to quickly
          add in additional fields. I held review sessions on these
