            various screens developed over the last 20 years that reflect a

          <p class="article-title">The Events Tab</p>
          <p>
            The Events tab was the first tab to be designed for Load Details.
            For this tab, I started with a blank slate since there were no
            existing patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were many iterations on this design, but below are the design
            patterns that arose from this work.

            <div class="caption-big">
              Initially a user lands on a table view of the events. This view
              allows for easy scanning of primary information. A user can click
              on a row to expose more of the event's details.

              After a user clicks on an event, the list of events minimize to
              the left of the drawer. A card displaying event details becomes
              exposed. The card defaults to showing the Overview tab which is
              the most important information. Secondary information resides on other
              tabs to which the user can easily navigate.

            This tab was originally completed by a team-member, but as
            we got closer to development there were some requirement changes
            that necessitated redesign.
          </p>
          <p>
            The design of the Items tab was heavily influenced by the designs of
            the Events tab.

              overview which contains all the primary information. However, just
              like the Events tab, secondary information resides on other
              tabs to which the user can easily navigate.

        <div class="section-body">
          <p class="article-title">The Attachments Tab</p>
          <p>
            Similar to Events, I used a table approach for the Attachments tab.
            One of the most important things to consider for Attachments is
            knowing which event that attachment is tied to. This can be very
            important for invoicing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Patterns that came out of this design are the simple table with actions
            revealed on hover and filter buttons for quick document searching.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-area">

                alt="Attachments table" />
            <div class="caption-big">
              The Attachments tab has a table of documents, links and signatures
              where a user can easily scan for or sort by specific document types.
            </div>
          </div>

            <img src="images/load-details/attachments-filters-zoom.png"
                      alt="Filter buttons on Attachments tab" />
            <div class="caption-big">
              Filter buttons lie below the tab header so the user can easily
              navigate to the document types they are looking for.
            </div>
            <img src="images/load-details/attachments-hover-zoom.png"
                      alt="Hover interaction over a row on Attachments table" />
            <div class="caption-big">
              On hover, the row reveals possible actions over a transparent
              background in case data is behind it. The row's hover interaction
              is the same as that of a different table that was recently
              developed to keep it consistent. Most often,
              a user is either viewing or adding an attachment which can be
              done by clicking the button in the top right of the drawer. It is
              less common to edit or remove an attachment.
            </div>

        <div class="section-body">
          <p class="article-title">The References Tab</p>
          <p>
            After the Attachments tab was designed, it was relatively simple to
            mockup the References tab. References have less complexity, including
            just a Reference Type, its value and the load that owns that
            reference.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-area">

                alt="References table on references tab" />
            <div class="caption-big">
              The References Tab also features a table. This is a more simple
              table though, with only one piece of information in a column.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class='img-with-caption'>
            <img src="images/load-details/references-filters-zoom.png"
                      alt="Filter buttons on the references tab" />
            <div class="caption-big">
              Similar to the Attachments tab, there is a simple table with the
              ability to filter results by clicking on a filter button. This
              helps users narrow down the list of references, which can be large.
            </div>
            <img src="images/load-details/references-hover-zoom.png"
                      alt="Hover interaction over a row on References table" />
            <div class="caption-big">
              Hovering over a reference row has the same interaction as an
              attachments row. Possible actions are revealed on the right over
              a transparent background. On References, a user can only edit or
              remove a reference.

        <div class="section-body">
          <p class="article-title">Just Keep Adding</p>
          <p>
            Adding details is one of the main actions a user can perform. My
            objective was to make the adding process consistent between tabs,
            so that adding equipment for a load is the same experience as adding
            an attachment or reference.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a user clicks on a button to add a detail, a drawer expands.
            The user can start typing to search for values within the dropdown
            or they can manually select a value. As soon as a value is selected,
            a row is added. Depending on the context, a row
            could have more data to enter. This pattern was
            scalable and able to be applied to multiple pages.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-area">

                alt="Add Equipment Drawer" />
            <div class="caption-big">
              On the Equipment & Services Tab, the only action a user can take
              is to add or remove equipment and services. After a user clicks on
              the button to Add Equipment, a drawer opens and a dropdown displays.
              The user can continue selecting values until all Equipment is
              added, then press Save. This is exactly the same design for
              adding Services.
            </div>

          <div class='img-with-caption'>

                      alt="Add Tracking Message drawer" />
            <div class="caption-big">
              When a load is in transit, a user may want to add multiple status
              messages for more accurate tracking. The Add Status Message drawer
              is heavily inspired by the Add Equipment drawer. A user selects a
              status from the dropdown and a row is added with some details.
              However, each row has a few more details for the user to fill out.

            On this project, I learned how important it is to consider multiple
            contexts when designing. A current design may impact future designs
            and scalability should be considered. I referenced previous mockups
            when doing new designs, but working on some of the new designs gave me
            ideas on how to improve some of the older designs. <br/><br/>
            This was a very iterative design process and designs continue to adjust
            as we develop these screens. Having a design system and
            defined patterns help make these quick adjustments.
