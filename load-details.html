            we deal with loads. For example, a load could be a trucking company
            carrying 100 pillows from Raleigh to Manhattan. We have a mix of
            various screens developed over the last 20 years that reflect a
            load's details like the origin and destination, the items on the
            truck and attachments.

          <p class="article-title">The First Tab</p>
          <p>
            This was the first tab to be designed for the Load Details drawer
            and I was the lead designer. For this tab, I was starting with a blank
            slate since we didn't have any patterns set.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were many iterations on this design, but here are the design
            patterns that arose from this work.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-area">
          <div class='img-with-caption'>

            <div class="caption-big">
              Initially a user lands on a table view of the events. This view
              allows for easy scanning of primary information. A user can click
              on a row to expose more of the event's details.

            <div class="caption-big">
              After a user clicks on an event, the list of events minimize to
              the left of the drawer. A card displaying event details becomes
              exposed. The card defaults to showing the Overview tab which is
              the most important information. Secondary information lies on other
              tabs that the user can easily navigate to.
            </div>

          <p>
            This tab came later. It was originally done by a team-member, but as
            we got closer to development, some requirements changed and I became
            the lead designer.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can see how the design of the events tab influenced the Items tab.

              After a user clicks on an item, the list of items minimize to
              the left of the drawer. A card displaying item details becomes
              exposed. This card is different in that it always shows the item
              overview which contains all the primary information. However, just
              like the Events tab, secondary information lies on other
              tabs that the user can easily navigate to.

          <p class="article-title">A Simple Approach</p>
          <p>
            Similar to Events, I used a table approach for the Attachments tab.
            One of the most important things to consider for Attachments is
            knowing which event that attachment is tied to. This can be very
            important for invoicing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Patterns that came out of this design are the simple table with actions
            revealed on hover and filter buttons for quick document searching.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-area">
          <div class='img-with-caption'>
            <img src="images/load-details/attachments-list.png"
                alt="Attachments table" />
            <div class="caption-big">
              Filter buttons lie below the tab header so the user can easily
              navigate to the document types they are looking for.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class='img-with-caption'>
            <img src="images/load-details/attachments-hover.png"
                      alt="Hover interaction over a row on Attachments table" />
            <div class="caption-big">
              On hover, the row reveals possible actions over a transparent
              background in case data is behind it. The row's hover interaction
              is the same as that of a different table that was recently
              developed to keep it consistent. Most often,
              a user is either viewing or adding an attachment which can be
              done by clicking the button in the top right of the drawer. It is
              less common to edit or remove an attachment.
            </div>

        <div class="section-body">
          <p class="article-title">The References Tab</p>
          <p>
            After the Attachments tab, it felt like the References tab was
            already designed. References have even less complexity, with
            just a Reference Type, it's value and the load that owns that
            reference. Users can assign the reference to be the Primary identifier
            for the load, but that is really all there is to it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-area">
          <div class='img-with-caption'>
            <img src="images/load-details/references-list.png"
                alt="References table on references tab" />
            <div class="caption-big">
              Just like the Attachments tab, there is a simple table with the
              ability to filter results by clicking on a filter button. This will
              help users narrow down the list of references, which can be large.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class='img-with-caption'>
            <img src="images/load-details/references-hover.png"
                      alt="Hover interaction over a row on References table" />
            <div class="caption-big">
              Hovering over a reference row has the same interaction as an
              attachments row. Possible actions are revealed on the right over
              a transparent background. On References, a user can only edit or
              remove a reference.
            </div>

      <h2 class="section-title">Add Screens</h2>
      <section class="work-rounds">
        <div class="section-body">
          <p class="article-title">Just Keep Adding</p>
          <p>
            Adding details is one of the main actions a user may perform. I
            wanted to making the adding process consistent between tabs, so that
            adding equipment for a load is the same experience as adding an
            attachment or reference.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pattern that I came up with is after clicking on a button to add
            something, a smaller drawer expands. The user can start typing to
            search for values in the dropdown or manually select a value. As
            soon as a value is selected, a row is added with that value and the
            dropdown to add values shifts down. Depending on the context, a row
            could have more data on each row to enter, or it could just be a
            list of values. This way of adding values was scalable and able to
            be used for multiple pages.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-area">
          <div class='img-with-caption'>
            <img src="images/load-details/equipment-add.png"
                alt="Add Equipment Drawer" />
            <div class="caption-big">
              On the Equipment & Services Tab, the only action a user can take
              is to add or remove equipment and services. After a user clicks on
              the button to Add Equipment, a drawer opens and a dropdown displays.
              The user can continue selecting values until all Equipment is
              added, then press Save. This is the same exact design for adding Services.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class='img-with-caption'>
            <img src="images/load-details/tracking-add.png"
                      alt="Add Tracking Message drawer" />
            <div class="caption-big">
              When a load is in transit, a user may want to add multiple status
              messages for more accurate tracking. The Add Status Message drawer
              is heavily inspired by the Add Equipment drawer. A user selects a
              status from the dropdown and a row is added with some details.
              However, each row has a few more details for the user to fill out.

          <p class="section-body">
            On this project, I learned how important it is to consider multiple
            contexts when designing. A current design may impact future designs
            and scalability should be considered. I referenced previous mockups
            when doing new designs, but working on some of the new designs gave me
            ideas on how to improve some of the older designs. <br/><br/>
            This was a very iterative design process and designs continue to adjust
            as we develop these screens. Having a design system and
            defined patterns help make these quick adjustments.
