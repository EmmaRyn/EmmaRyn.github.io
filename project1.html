            <p><span class="article-title">Here's The Scoop</span><br/>
            There are so many sources to get recipes like websites, friends,
            family, meal subscription services and cookbooks. This allows
            recipes to come in many different formats and say you want to get
            your Mom’s Mac & Cheese recipe - where do you go? Check your email?
            Dig through a drawer? There needs to be a common place to store all
            sort of recipes.</p>
            <p class="bold">This is where Heirloom comes in.</p>
            <p>But with a cloud recipes application comes some challenges:</p>
          </div>
          <ul class="section-body">
            <li>
              <p class="article-title">Competition</p>
              <p>
                Since there are so many storage applications out there, I really
                needed to design one that would make users choose this one and
                still meet the standards of existing apps.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="article-title">Complexity and Flexibility</p>
              <p>
                A recipe on a website has cook time, servings, nutrition,
                ingredients, directions and images all laid out. A lot of this
                information isn’t immediately available if it’s a family recipe
                or you haven’t made it yet. This application needs to be able
                to hold all the important information without relying on it all
                 being available on creation.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="article-title">Simplicity</p>
              <p>
                Recipe sites that currently exist all have a lot going on. This
                application needed to be designed so that it was able to do
                everything that a recipe application needed to do without being
                overwhelming and difficult to use.

              With 29 survey participants, I was able to learn a lot about how
              cloud storage apps are used now, what people like and dislike
              about them and I could gauge interest in a recipe-focused app.
            </p>
            <p>
              This confirmed the direction of the app and was extremely helpful
              in the creation and prioritization of user stories.

              Jasmine just graduated from college, moved to a new city and started
              her first job as a journalist for a local paper. As it's her first
              time living on her own and she didn’t cook much in college, she is
              now in charge of her meals for the first time ever. She loved
              what her mom always cooked and she wants to have those on file.
              Right now when she needs a recipe, she calls her mom and her mom
              will email or text it. Jasmine is frustrated because she never
              knows where to go to find that recipe her mom sent her that one
              time and she has to ask her mom to resend the recipe often.

            Going through the process of creating wireframes and testing them
            put the user flows into perspective. After creating some screens
            needed for adding a recipe, I realized that some screens should be
            reordered and some things needed to be thought about more in depth.

            The usability testing of the wireframe prototype revealed that the

              Determining the font styles and the primary branding colors greatly
              improved the efficiency of creating the mockups. It gave me
              guidelines to begin my work with.  Once I could see how those
              branding decisions affected the designs and prototype testing, then
              I was able to tweak here and there. I ended up removing the darkest
              color from the styleguide as that was never used, I tweaked the
              icons and removed the logos that seemed like they would never be
              utilized.

              I also spent some time on logo design. The shape of the tomato
              changed. Then I played with coloring and brand fonts. Then I tried
              some different text placement. I ended with this logo which I am
              pretty happy with as it is my first logo design.

            The first mockup I created attempted to mimic an actual recipe
            card. The feedback from the usability testing that most greatly
            influenced the final design was how different the “add recipe”
            screens were from the “view recipe” screens. Being able to
            visualize the end-result when creating the recipe is extremely
            important. Overall, the process of adding a recipe could be
            simplified and the hierarchy of the home page also needed some
            adjustment.

            Using the feedback from the design critique, I created a second
            hi-fi mockup. It kept similar styling but laid out the information
            on the page in a different way. The “view recipe” screen more
            closely matched the “add recipe” screens, but the design was still
            just a little too bland and the process of adding a recipe needed
            some rework. Users needed to be guided through the process and
            didn’t know where to begin adding a recipe.

            The third mockup was a lot cleaner. The “add” and “view” recipe
            screens matched exactly and users had a much easier time adding a
            recipe. They knew where to begin and felt like this would be
            extremely useful when actually cooking. The one thing that lacked
            in this version was the branding. It was missing the “homey” and
            “rustic” feel that the home page has. It was also missing some
            information that users were asking for like Cook Time and Servings.

            The final mockup added the missing information, a “Print Recipe”
            icon and adjusted some font and icon sizing. The designs were all
            updated to make sure that branding was consistent and clean.

            There was a prototype for almost every version of high-fidelity
            mockups, but here is the final prototype which allows you to
            create an account, add a recipe and view the recipe.

            Recipes are more complicated than I thought, but all the users who
            tested were excited to use this application. I learned a lot about
            the importance of simplicity, consistency and hierarchy when
            designing an application. Also, finding inspiration from existing
            sites and designs is key for having a design that matches modern
            trends.
