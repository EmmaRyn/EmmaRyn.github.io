            <p class="article-title">Here's The Scoop</p>
            <p>There are so many sources to get recipes like websites, friends,
            family, meal subscription services and cookbooks. This allows
            recipes to come in many different formats and say you want to get
            your Mom’s Mac & Cheese recipe - where do you go? Check your email?
            Dig through a drawer? There needs to be a common place to store all
            sort of recipes.</p>
            <p class="bold">This is where Heirloom comes in.</p>
            <p>But with a cloud recipes application comes some challenges:</p>
          </div>
          <ul class="section-body">
            <li>
              <p class="article-title">Competition</p>
              <p>
                Since there are so many storage applications out there, I really
                needed to design one that would make users choose this one and
                still meet the standards of existing apps.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="article-title">Complexity and Flexibility</p>
              <p>
                A recipe on a website has cook time, servings, nutrition,
                ingredients, directions and images all laid out. A lot of this
                information isn’t immediately available if it’s a family recipe
                or you haven’t made it yet. This application needs to be able
                to hold all the important information without relying on it all
                 being available on creation.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="article-title">Simplicity</p>
              <p>
                Recipe sites that currently exist all have a lot going on. This
                application needed to be designed so that it was able to do
                everything that a recipe application needed to do without being
                overwhelming and difficult to use.

              With 29 survey participants, I was able to learn a lot about how
              cloud storage apps are used now, what people like and dislike
              about them and I could gauge interest in a recipe-focused app.
            </p>
            <p>
              This confirmed the direction of the app and was extremely helpful
              in the creation and prioritization of user stories.

              The onboarding flow was easy since I was able to reference

              I used the user stories to determine what needs to be included

            Going through the process of creating wireframes and testing them
            put the user flows into perspective. After creating some screens
            needed for adding a recipe, I realized that some screens should be

            The usability testing of the wireframe prototype revealed that the

            Determining the font styles and the primary branding colors greatly
            improved the efficiency of creating the mockups. It gave me
            guidelines to begin my work with.  Once I could see how those
            branding decisions affected the designs and prototype testing, then
            I was able to tweak here and there. I ended up removing the darkest
            color from the styleguide as that was never used, I tweaked the
            icons and removed the logos that seemed like they would never be
            utilized.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also spent some time on logo design. The shape of the tomato
            changed. Then I played with coloring and brand fonts. Then I tried
            some different text placement. I ended with this logo which I am
            pretty happy with as it is my first logo design.

            The first mockup I created attempted to mimic an actual recipe
            card. The feedback from the usability testing that most greatly
            influenced the final design was how different the “add recipe”
            screens were from the “view recipe” screens. Being able to
            visualize the end-result when creating the recipe is extremely
            important. Overall, the process of adding a recipe could be
            simplified and the hierarchy of the home page also needed some
            adjustment.

            <p class="caption">
              This is the first high-fidelity mockup of the recipe page. I
              took the wireframe and made it look more similar to a real recipe
              card. I also reduced screens by having more information on
              one tab instead of multiple.

              This is the first high-fidelity mockup of adding ingredients to a
              recipe. The wireframe version did not have visibility into the process
              of adding a recipe which caused confusion. This version shows the user
              all the steps of adding a recipe.

            Using the feedback from the design critique, I created a second
            hi-fi mockup. It kept similar styling but laid out the information
            on the page in a different way. The “view recipe” screen more
            closely matched the “add recipe” screens, but the design was still
            just a little too bland and the process of adding a recipe needed
            some rework. Users needed to be guided through the process and
            didn’t know where to begin adding a recipe.

              This mockup organizes the information in a layout that shows more

              This version of adding a recipe keeps everything on one page instead

            The third mockup was a lot cleaner. The “add” and “view” recipe
            screens matched exactly and users had a much easier time adding a
            recipe. They knew where to begin and felt like this would be
            extremely useful when actually cooking. The one thing that lacked
            in this version was the branding. It was missing the “homey” and
            “rustic” feel that the home page has. It was also missing some
            information that users were asking for like Cook Time and Servings.

              This mockup came after testing a few variations of layouts using
              a preference test. I used the most liked parts of each layout and
              turned them into this mockup. It is similar to the last mockup but
              this one presents the information in a customizable card
              layout.

            <p class="caption">
              The card layout makes it more obvious that all the information is
              optional. This also keeps the screen cleaner if the user does not
              have all the information like the nutrition data or an image. The area to
              add ingredients and directions was moved to the bottom of the panels
              so it more closely reflects how you add items to a list.

            Recipes are more complicated than I thought, but all the users who
            tested were excited to use this application. I learned a lot about
            the importance of simplicity, consistency and hierarchy when
            designing an application. Also, finding inspiration from existing
            sites and designs is key for having a design that matches modern
